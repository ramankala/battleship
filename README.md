<h1> Battleship </h1>

<h2>Brief Introduction </h2>

Web application that implements the famous game 'Battleship'.  This project encapsulates and ingrains my research on Test Driven Development as I incorporate unit testing throughout the project building process to gain a deeper understanding of it.  This will be the final project using vanilla JS, and will serve as a substantial final practice for DOM manipulation before moving on to ReactJS.

<h2>Skills Demonstrated</h2>

The skills I aim to raise and develop during this project are mainly my skills in TDD.  By getting used to building unit tests in Jest for functions that run in the back-end of this project, it will further improve my abilities to build modular and cleaner code.  Furthermore, it gives me a chance to practice building pure functions, and lastly it helps me master DOM manipulation.

<h2>Challenges I Faced</h2>

Challenges on this project I had dealt with were getting used to Jest, changing my approach to coding, and connecting the ships on the game board with the ship objects.  Firstly, the challenges I had with Jest was getting used with the program and being able to tell the program what output I am looking for.  Telling the program to look for string outputs was simple enough, I had to spend a bit of time learning how to check arrays and objects that are stored in 2D arrays through Jest.  Secondly, instead of coding right away, I had to change my approach and think about what the result should be, and then create code that satisfies that result.  This 'green light, red light' approach turned out to be fun!  Lastly, I had some troubles trying to decide how to connect the shots landed on the board on the webpage, to the board stored in an array in the back-end.  After spending some time on how to approach the logic, I was satisfied with what I was able to come up with.

<h2>How to Play</h2>

DRAG ship pieces on the board, when all pieces are on the board a start button will appear.

START the game by clicking the button.

CLICK on spaces on your opponents board to try and attack their ships.  hits are registered as red, and misses as grey.  Game ends when all ships on either board are wiped out.
